## VampireSlayer
Welcome to Vampire Slayer! In this brainteaser game you are a hero who has been tasked with slaying a vampire. The vampire is hiding in one of seven caskets. Each day you will choose a casket to open. If you open the casket with the vampire, you win. If you open the wrong casket, the vampire gets to hide in a new casket. You only have four days to slay the vampire. Can you think of a strategy to consistently slay the vampire in four days or less? Good luck!
