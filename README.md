## VampireSlayer
Welcome to Vampire Slayer! In this brainteaser game you are a hero who has been tasked with slaying a vampire. The vampire is hiding in one of seven caskets. Each day you will choose a casket to open. If you open the casket with the vampire, you win. If you open the wrong casket, the vampire gets to hide in a new casket. You only have four days to slay the vampire. Can you think of a strategy to consistently slay the vampire in four days or less? Good luck!

## movToGif
This is a simple script that converts a .mov file to a .gif file. It uses the moviepy module to do the conversion. The script takes two arguments: the path of the .mov file and the path of the .gif file. For example, if you have a .mov file at `~/Movies/myMovie.mov` and you want to convert it to a .gif file at `~/Movies/myGif.gif`, you would run the script as follows:

```
python movToGif.py ~/Movies/myMovie.mov ~/Movies/myGif.gif
```
